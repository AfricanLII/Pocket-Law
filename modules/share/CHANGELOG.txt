#659606 by dww, greenSkin: Added js-hide class to Share block content div and
  removed JavaScript code that was hiding the same div.
#494602 by Gribnif, greenSkin: Simplified widget loading query. Node types now
  obeyed when "where to display" is "link".
#461980 by Gribnif: Now using the url() function in link codes. Changed from
  saying "Click here to view", instead using a 'View "[title]"' syntax passing
  the node title through check_plain(). Removed various redundancies with link
  code generation.
